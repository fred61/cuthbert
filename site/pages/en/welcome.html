<p>
The Happy Nest is an English-speaking play and learn group for children aged two and a half to five. We focus on activities that support and encourage the child's natural development in all five of the major areas: language, emotional, cognitive, physical, and social skills. 
</p>
<p>
We strongly believe that a playgroup should provide an environment and atmosphere where children can have fun, socialize and grow in confidence. The Happy Nest encourages learning through play and helps to foster emotional, physical and social development. Your child will learn to interact with others, advance their language skills and have ample opportunity to hone fine and gross motor skills. With two qualified staff each child  will experience group and individual encouragement to learn at their own pace in a relaxed but challenging environment.

We also offer places for full immersion into English as a foreign language.
