<p>
At the Happy Nest English Club children's literacy skills are fostered by a qualified teacher basing her methods around the <a href="http://jollylearning.co.uk/overview-about-jolly-phonics/">Jolly Phonics</a> system. The class size is kept small (maximum of 10 children for Beginners and Intermediate levels, 6 for the Advanced level) to allow a maximum of personal attention to each child. 
</p>
<p>
There are three levels, each with a dedicated session.
