At the Happy Nest we have made it our ultimate goal to provide a well equipped and interesting environment  and to encourage your child's development and joy of learning, without undue stress or frustration.

The playgroup provides the children with a structured  morning and begins with a short circle time. This will include songs depicting the letter of the week, the weather and seasons. Different objects, and materials from the shelves will be introduced and demonstrated which the child can then choose to use later.
