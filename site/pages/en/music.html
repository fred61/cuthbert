Happy Music has been designed to bring music to your children; presented in a fun and entertaining session that will have them singing, dancing, and playing music instruments while developing a multitude of skills which will benefit their personal development. Studies have shown that music education provides a workout for the brain and helps with brain development, focus, concentration, thinking, self confidence, self expression and obviously, provides pure enjoyment.

Happy Music is for children between 3 and 5. Classes take place on Thursdays, 15:30 - 16:30.

Each class comprises a combination of singing, movement, playing instruments, listening to and learning about music. The focus of our music time is to make ‘tuneful’, ‘beatful’ and ‘artful’ children. ‘Tuneful’ focuses on singing; we sing a range of songs from traditional children songs and nursery rhymes to popular music. It is wonderful to help children discover their singing voices, enabling them to sing anywhere, anytime. ‘Beatful’ means that we are discovering the fundamentals of rhythm. Keeping a steady beat on a percussive instrument, clapping and moving in time to the music are skills that come through practise. ‘Artful’ implies that we are gifting the children an insight to music as an art form; we listen and appreciate a large repertoire of music, we feel the emotions that music conveys, we have fun with music games, we move in response to music and, most importantly, we foster a lifelong love of music.
