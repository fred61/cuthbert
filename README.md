Happy Nest projects v2.0

The site project contains the public facing web site. Originally created in Drupal, I found it easier to reimplement it in JS rather than trying to upgrade from Drupal 6 to Drupal 8.

The ui.ng2 project contains the UI part of the admin web site.

The svc.php contains the PHP implementation of the services used by the admin web site. 

Eventually there will be other projects to implement the services part in other technologies (JEE and Spring Boot come to mind).
